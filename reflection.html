    <h1>Reflection: AI in Web Development</h1>

    <h2>Which AI tool(s) did you use?</h2>
    <p>
      I used <strong>ChatGPT</strong> to assist with coding parts of my landing page. Specifically, ChatGPT helped me generate one of the HTML sections and the CSS styling for layout and responsiveness.
    </p>

    <h2>How did it help you?</h2>
    <p>
      ChatGPT helped speed up the design process by providing structured and readable code. It suggested layout techniques, animation for buttons, and tips for responsive design. It also helped ensure that the layout matched a visual example I was working from. This guidance made it easier to create a clean and professional-looking page.
    </p>

    <h2>What challenges did you encounter?</h2>
    <p>
      One challenge I faced was with external image links not displaying properly on GitHub Pages. Some images generated or linked from external sources didn’t show up, so I learned how to replace them with placeholder images or upload assets directly to GitHub. I also had to adjust some CSS for better mobile responsiveness.
    </p>

    <h2>What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?</h2>
    <p>
      I learned that AI tools are powerful assistants in the development process. They don’t replace coding skills, but they enhance productivity and creativity. AI can provide a helpful starting point, solve layout issues, and offer suggestions for cleaner, modern code. However, it's still important to understand what the code does and to troubleshoot or customize as needed.
